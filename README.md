# LabelingParser
Code for implementing *typed dependency parser* it is a refactor of [this project](https://github.com/shentianxiao/RBGParser/blob/labeling/README.md). 
The refactor removed the code that measures the accuracy of the model, the input parameters from terminal and support for other languages. Now it works just for english.
